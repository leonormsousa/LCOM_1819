Developed during the course Computer Laboratory in FEUP, in collaboration with SÃ­lvia Rocha (@silviavrocha).

Description of the course:
This course unit aims to endow students with the knowledge and the skills required to:
1. Use the hardware interface of the most common computer I/O devices;
2. Develop low-level/system-level and embedded programs
3. Use software tools typical of large programming projects

Several short lab assignments, each focusing on one I/O device.
One integration project: must use at least 3 different I/O devices, must use interrupts and should use both C and assembly.
